        "1. **Course Class (Superclass):**\n",
        "   - Define a superclass named `Course` with the following attributes:\n",
        "     - `course_code` (string): The unique identifier for the course.\n",
        "     - `course_name` (string): The official name of the course.\n",
        "     - `credits` (integer): The credit value of the course.\n",
        "     - `department` (string): The academic department the course belongs to.\n",
        "   - Implement an `__init__` method that initializes a `Course` with the attributes listed above.\n",
        "   - Include the following methods in the `Course` class:\n",
        "     - `display_info()`: Prints the course's details, including its code, name, credits, and department.\n",
        "     - `is_elective()`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the course is an elective.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **UndergraduateCourse Class (Subclass):**\n",
        "   - Create a subclass named `UndergraduateCourse` that inherits from `Course`. Add the following additional attributes:\n",
        "     - `prerequisites` (list of strings): A list of course codes that are prerequisites.\n",
        "     - `year_offered` (integer): The year in which the course is typically offered.\n",
        "   - Override the `__init__` method to include initialization of the new attributes while ensuring the inherited attributes are also initialized.\n",
        "   - Override the `display_info()` method to include prerequisites and year offered.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **GraduateCourse Class (Subclass):**\n",
        "   - Create a subclass named `GraduateCourse` that inherits from `Course`. Add the following additional attribute:\n",
        "     - `research_component` (boolean): Indicates whether the course includes a research component.\n",
        "     - `professor` (string): The name of the professor teaching the course.\n",
        "   - Override the `__init__` method to include initialization of the new attributes while ensuring the inherited attributes are also initialized.\n",
        "   - Override the `display_info()` method to include research component and professor's name.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Testing Your Code:**\n",
        "   - Create instances of `UndergraduateCourse` and `GraduateCourse` with relevant attributes.\n",
        "   - Demonstrate the use of each method, including inherited and overridden methods, by interacting with both `UndergraduateCourse` and `GraduateCourse` instances.\n",
